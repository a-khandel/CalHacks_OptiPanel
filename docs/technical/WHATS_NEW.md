# What's New - Enhanced Revenue Recovery System

## üéâ Major Upgrade Complete!

Your AI voice agent has been transformed from a basic check-in system into a **Revenue Recovery Specialist** with strategic negotiation capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced AI Personality

**Before**: Generic customer success rep
```
"Hi, we noticed you haven't been active. Everything okay?"
```

**After**: Expert Revenue Recovery Specialist
```
"Hi Sarah! We noticed you haven't been as active lately, and honestly,
we'd hate to lose you as a customer. Do you have a couple minutes to
chat about what's going on?"
```

### 2. Strategic Conversation Framework

The AI now follows a proven **5-Phase Framework**:

1. **Discovery** - Build rapport, understand the problem
2. **Qualification** - Determine if they're saveable
3. **Value Re-alignment** - Remind them why they signed up
4. **Negotiation** - Offer strategic incentives
5. **Close** - Get commitment and next steps

### 3. Negotiation Authority

The AI can now offer:

‚úÖ **20-30% discounts** (automatic approval)
- "What if I could get you 30% off for the next 3 months?"

‚úÖ **40-50% discounts** (simulated manager approval)
- "Let me talk to my manager and see what I can do..."

‚úÖ **Free months of service**
- "What if I gave you 2 months free to come back when you're ready?"

‚úÖ **Premium upgrades at current price**
- "I can upgrade you to premium at your current $50/month rate"

‚úÖ **VIP perks**
- 1-on-1 onboarding sessions
- Priority support access
- Beta feature access

### 4. Conversation Intelligence

The AI is trained to handle different objection types:

**Price Objections**:
```
User: "It's too expensive"
AI: "I completely understand. What if I could get you 30% off for
     3 months? That brings it to just $35/month."
```

**Feature Gaps**:
```
User: "You don't have X feature"
AI: "Perfect timing! We're launching that next month. Let me get
     you beta access and 25% off while you test it."
```

**Competition**:
```
User: "I found a competitor"
AI: "What specifically are they offering? I might be able to match
     or beat that value for you."
```

**Timing Issues**:
```
User: "I'm just too busy right now"
AI: "Would it make sense to pause your account instead of canceling?
     Or I could give you 2 months free to come back when ready."
```

### 5. Enhanced Configuration

Updated [src/config/vapi.config.js](src/config/vapi.config.js):
- Higher temperature (0.8) for more natural conversations
- 10-minute max call duration
- Improved interrupt sensitivity

  }'
```
