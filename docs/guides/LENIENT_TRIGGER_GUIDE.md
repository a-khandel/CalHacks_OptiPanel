# 🎯 LENIENT TRIGGER SYSTEM - ONE TIME ONLY

## The 3 Triggers (ONLY):

### 1. 🛒 Long-Time Cart Abandonment
**What**: Cart has items for **5+ minutes** without checkout
**Why**: User is hesitating, needs help making decision
**Example**:
```
User adds 2 products to cart
Waits 5 minutes browsing
🔴 TRIGGER: "Cart has 2 items (worth $59.98) for 5 minutes without checkout"
📞 Call initiated!
```

### 2. 🗑️ Cart Item Removed
**What**: User **removed items** from cart (showing disinterest)
**Why**: User changed their mind, need to save the sale
**Example**:
```
User has 3 items in cart
Removes 1 item
🔴 TRIGGER: "Removed 1 item(s) from cart - showing disinterest!"
📞 Call initiated!
```

### 3. 😴 Long-Time Inactive
**What**: User hasn't visited website in **24+ hours**
**Why**: User forgot about us, need re-engagement
**Example**:
```
User last visited yesterday
Comes back 25 hours later
🔴 TRIGGER: "User hasn't visited in 25 hours - re-engagement needed!"
📞 Call initiated!
```

---

## ONE TIME ONLY Rule:

✅ Each user can **ONLY be called ONCE** in their lifetime
❌ **NEVER** call the same user twice
🔒 Once called, user is **permanently marked** as "already contacted"

---

## How It Works:

### First Visit - Cart Abandonment Test:
```
1. User adds product to cart
   🟢 Long-Time Cart Abandonment
   🟢 Cart Item Removed
   🟢 Long-Time Inactive
   ⏱️ Started tracking cart timer

2. User waits 3 minutes
   🟢 Long-Time Cart Abandonment (need 5 min)
   🟢 Cart Item Removed
   🟢 Long-Time Inactive
   ⏱️ Cart timer: 3 minutes

3. User waits 5+ minutes
   🔴 Long-Time Cart Abandonment (5+ min!) ← TRIGGER!
   🟢 Cart Item Removed
   🟢 Long-Time Inactive
   🚨 TRIGGERING AI CALL!
   📞 Call initiated to +14155797753
   🔒 User marked as called - NEVER CALLING AGAIN

4. User comes back tomorrow
   🟢 Long-Time Cart Abandonment
   🟢 Cart Item Removed
   🟢 Long-Time Inactive
   ⛔ User already called once - NEVER calling again
```

### Cart Item Removal Test:
```
1. User has 3 items in cart
   Previous cart: 0 items
   Current cart: 3 items
   🟢 Cart Item Removed (no change)

2. User removes 1 item
   Previous cart: 3 items
   Current cart: 2 items
   🔴 Cart Item Removed (3 → 2) ← TRIGGER!
   🚨 TRIGGERING AI CALL!
   📞 Call initiated
   🔒 NEVER calling this user again
```

---

## Testing:

### Test 1: Cart Abandonment (5 min wait)
```bash
1. Start backend + dummy_website
2. Add product to cart
3. Wait 5 minutes (browse around, don't checkout)
4. Check backend console:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS (LENIENT MODE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
User: Guest User
Already Called: NO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Trigger Signals:
🔴 Long-Time Cart Abandonment (5+ min)  ← RED = TRIGGERED!
🟢 Cart Item Removed
🟢 Long-Time Inactive
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 TRIGGERING AI CALL!
📞 Call initiated!
🔒 User marked - WILL NEVER BE CALLED AGAIN
```

### Test 2: Cart Item Removal (instant)
```bash
1. Add 2 products to cart
2. Remove 1 product
3. Backend console:

Trigger Signals:
🟢 Long-Time Cart Abandonment

🟢 Long-Time Inactive
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 TRIGGERING AI CALL!
```

### Test 3: One-Time Only Enforcement
```bash
1. Trigger a call (any method above)
2. Try to trigger again (wait 5+ min with cart)
3. Backend console:

Already Called: YES - NEVER CALLING AGAIN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ⛔ User already called once - NEVER calling again
✅ User OK - no call needed
```

## Thresholds (Configurable):

| Trigger | Threshold | Can Change To |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Cart Abandonment | 5 minutes | 3 min, 10 min, etc. |
| Inactive User | 24 hours | 12 hrs, 48 hrs, etc. |
| One-Time Call | Permanent | Cannot change (design choice) |

To adjust thresholds, edit:
```javascript
// src/services/engagementDetector.js
this.CART_ABANDON_THRESHOLD_MS = 300000; // 5 min (change this)
this.INACTIVE_THRESHOLD_MS = 86400000; // 24 hrs (change this)
```

---

## What Happens When Triggered:

1. **Instant Analysis** → Detects one of 3 triggers
2. **Check History** → Has this user been called before?
3. **If NO** → Trigger call
4. **If YES** → Skip (never call again)
5. **AI Calls** → +14155797753
6. **Personalized Script** → Based on trigger reason
7. **Mark User** → Permanently in call history
