# Revenue Recovery AI Agent Guide

## Overview

Your AI agent is now a **Revenue Recovery Specialist** trained to convert churning users back into active customers through strategic negotiation and empathetic conversation.

## What's Changed

### Before (Basic Check-in)
- Simple "How are things going?" approach
- Generic responses
- No negotiation capability
- Passive conversation

### After (Revenue Recovery Expert)
- Strategic 5-phase conversation framework
- Active problem discovery and negotiation
- Discount authority up to 50%
- Trained to convert dead revenue into active revenue

## The 5-Phase Conversation Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery
**Goal**: Build rapport and understand the problem

The AI will:
- Start with genuine empathy
- Ask open-ended questions about their experience
- Listen actively and dig deeper
- Identify the ROOT CAUSE (pricing, features, usability, competition, timing)

**Example conversation**:
```
AI: "Thanks for taking my call! I really appreciate it. So, what's been your experience
     with our platform lately?"

User: "Honestly, I just haven't had time to use it much."

AI: "I totally understand. When did you first start noticing you weren't using it as much?
     Was there something specific that changed?"
```

### Phase 2: Qualification
**Goal**: Determine if they're saveable

The AI asks key questions:
- "Is this something you're looking to solve, or have you already moved on?"
- "What would need to change for you to be excited about using our platform again?"
- "Have you found an alternative solution?"

If they've already fully committed to a competitor â†’ Thank them gracefully
If they're frustrated but haven't left â†’ Perfect opportunity!

### Phase 3: Value Re-alignment
**Goal**: Remind them why they signed up

The AI will:
- Highlight features they might have missed
- Share relevant success stories
- Create urgency with upcoming features
- Reframe the value proposition

**Example**:
```
AI: "You know, we're actually launching a new analytics dashboard next month that
     I think would solve exactly what you mentioned. And based on how you were using
     the platform before, I think you'd really benefit from our automation features -
     have you tried those?"
```

### Phase 4: Negotiation & Recovery
**Goal**: Offer strategic incentives to win them back

The AI has authority to offer:

#### For PRICE Objections:
- **20-30% discount** for 3-6 months (automatic approval)
- **40-50% discount** (will say "let me check with my manager")
- Free month of service
- Discount + upgrade combo

**Example negotiation**:
```
User: "It's just too expensive for what I'm getting."

AI: "I completely understand budget concerns - that's totally valid. Let me see what
     I can do for you. What if I could get you 30% off for the next 3 months? That
     would bring it down to just $35/month. Would that make it worth giving us
     another shot?"
```

#### For FEATURE Gaps:
- Beta access to new features
- Direct connection to product team
- Custom feature prioritization

#### For USABILITY Issues:
- 1-on-1 personalized onboarding
- VIP support access
- Dedicated success manager

#### For COMPETITION:
- Match or beat competitor value
- Highlight unique differentiators
- Offer trial of premium tier

#### For TIMING Issues:
- Account pause instead of cancellation
- 2 months free to come back later
- Flexible scheduling

### Phase 5: Close the Deal
**Goal**: Get commitment and next steps

The AI will:
- Summarize the offer clearly
- Create a specific call-to-action
- Get verbal commitment
- Set clear expectations and follow-up

**Example close**:
```
AI: "Okay, so to recap - I can offer you 30% off for the next 3 months, which brings
     you to $35/month, plus I'll personally set up a training session with you next week
     to make sure you're getting the most out of the platform. Can I go ahead and apply
     that discount to your account right now?"

User: "Yeah, that sounds good."

AI: "Awesome! I'm really glad we could work this out. I'll send you a confirmation
     email with all the details, and I'll check in with you in 2 weeks to make sure
     everything's going great. Sound good?"
```

## Negotiation Authority

The AI can offer **without manager approval**:
- âœ… Up to 30% discount for 3-6 months
- âœ… One free month of service
- âœ… Upgrade to premium at current price
- âœ… 1-on-1 onboarding session
- âœ… Priority support access

For bigger requests (40-50% discount):
- Will say: "Let me talk to my manager and call you back"
- Makes customer feel special and valued

## Critical Conversation Rules

The AI is trained to:

1. **Be GENUINELY EMPATHETIC** - Real conversation, not a script
2. **LISTEN MORE THAN TALK** - 60/40 rule
3. **Not be pushy** - If they're done, let them go gracefully
4. **Focus on VALUE over price** - Price is often not the real issue
5. **Make them feel SPECIAL** - VIP treatment
6. **Get COMMITMENT** - Always close with next steps
7. **End professionally** - Leave the door open

## Tonality & Style

**Voice characteristics**:
- Conversational and warm (not robotic)
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful, not desperate
- Professional but personable
- "I'm here to help you win" energy

**Red flags** (AI will end call gracefully):
- Hostile or abusive behavior
- Repeated "not interested" statements
- Already signed long-term with competitor
- Never actually used the product

## Real Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Price Objection

```
AI: "Hey Sarah! This is Alex from Apple's customer success team. We noticed you
     haven't been as active lately, and honestly, we'd hate to lose you. Got a
     couple minutes to chat?"

User: "Sure, I guess."

AI: "Thanks! I really appreciate you taking my call. So what's been going on?
     What's your experience been like with the platform?"

User: "It's fine, but honestly it's just too expensive right now. Budget's tight."

AI: "I totally get it - budget concerns are real. Can I ask, is it the price itself,
     or more about the value you're getting for what you're paying?"

User: "Probably a bit of both. I'm just not using it enough to justify the cost."

AI: "That makes sense. What if we could solve both problems? I'm thinking - what if
     I got you 30% off for the next 3 months, AND I personally walk you through some
     features that I think would make you use it way more. That'd bring it to $35/month.
     Would that be worth it?"

User: "Yeah, actually that would help."

AI: "Awesome! I'm excited to make this work. Let me apply that discount right now,
     and I'll send you a calendar invite for a quick 20-minute session next week.
     We'll get you set up with the automation features - I think you're going to
     love them. Sound good?"

User: "Yeah, sounds good!"

AI: "Perfect! You'll get a confirmation email in a few minutes, and I'll check back
     with you in two weeks to make sure everything's working great. Thanks so much
     for giving us another shot, Sarah!"
```

**Result**: Customer retained with 30% discount + training = Revenue saved! ðŸ’°

### Example 2: Feature Gap

```
AI: "Hi John! Quick call from Apple. Noticed your usage dropped and wanted to see
     what's up. Got a minute?"

User: "Yeah... honestly I found another tool that does what I need."

AI: "Ah okay, fair enough. What specifically does the other tool do that you're not
     getting from us? I'm curious."

User: "They have better analytics - I can actually see my data trends over time."

AI: "Oh man, that's actually perfect timing! We're literally launching our new
     analytics dashboard next month, and it's way more powerful than what we have
     now. Real-time trends, custom reports, the whole thing. Have you already
     committed to the other platform, or are you still evaluating?"

User: "I'm in a free trial, nothing committed yet."

AI: "Okay perfect. Here's what I'm thinking - what if I got you beta access to our
     new dashboard starting next week? You'd be one of the first to use it, and I'd
     love your feedback. Plus, I can throw in 25% off for 6 months while you test it
     out. That way you can compare both and make the right call. Fair?"

User: "Yeah, I'd be willing to try that."

AI: "Awesome! I'll get you set up with beta access today, and I'll personally email
     you the details. Let's plan to reconnect in a month after you've had a chance
     to use both. Deal?"
```

**Result**: Customer stays, provides valuable beta feedback, potential advocate! ðŸš€

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goal
âœ… Get customer to commit to staying/returning

### Secondary Goal
âœ… Understand exactly WHY they're leaving (for product improvement)

### Bonus
âœ… Turn them into a promoter by exceeding expectations

## Expected Outcomes

Based on industry standards for revenue recovery calls:

- **20-30%** of contacted users will re-engage
- **50%+** will provide valuable feedback
- **15-20%** become advocates after feeling heard

For a company with 10,000 users:
- 500 churning monthly (5% churn rate)
- 100-150 recovered (20-30% recovery rate)
- **$60,000 - $90,000 annual revenue saved**

## Tips for Demo

When demonstrating at CalHacks:

1. **Show the script**: Display the system prompt to judges
2. **Do a live call**: Call yourself and have a real conversation
3. **Show different scenarios**: Price objection, feature gap, competitor
4. **Highlight the negotiation**: Show how AI offers discounts strategically
5. **Emphasize ROI**: One recovered $100/mo customer = 667 calls worth of cost

## Configuration Options

You can customize the negotiation parameters in your code:

```javascript
// Adjust discount authority
const maxDiscountAutoApproved = 0.30; // 30%
const maxDiscountWithApproval = 0.50; // 50%

// Customize pricing tiers
const standardPrice = 50;
const premiumPrice = 100;

// Adjust based on user lifetime value
if (userLTV > 1000) {
  // Be more generous with high-value customers
  maxDiscount = 0.50;
}
```

## Advanced Features to Add

Future enhancements you could build:

1. **Dynamic pricing based on LTV** - Offer bigger discounts to high-value customers
2. **A/B testing scripts** - Test different negotiation approaches
3. **Sentiment analysis** - Detect frustration and adjust strategy
4. **CRM integration** - Auto-update customer records with call outcomes
5. **Manager escalation** - Transfer to human for complex situations
6. **Win-back campaigns** - Follow-up sequences based on call results

## Legal & Ethical Notes

- AI discloses it's calling from your company
- All calls are recorded (disclosed in greeting)
- Users can opt-out or hang up anytime
- Discounts must be honored (automated application)
- Complies with TCPA regulations for outbound calls
