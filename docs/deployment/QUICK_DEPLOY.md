## Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't connect to backend?
- Check that `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel matches your Railway URL exactly
- Make sure Railway URL includes `https://` and has NO trailing slash

### Backend not starting?
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Make sure VAPI and Claude API keys are valid

### Calls not working?
- Check Railway logs - look for `ðŸ“ž Initiating call...`
- Verify VAPI_API_KEY and VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID are correct
- Check DEFAULT_CALL_NUMBER is a valid phone number with country code
