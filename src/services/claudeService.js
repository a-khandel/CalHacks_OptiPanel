- Items in Cart: ${cartItems}
- Checkout Started: ${userMetrics.checkoutStarted || false}
- Order Completed: ${userMetrics.orderCompleted || false}
- Hours Since Last Visit: ${timeSinceLastVisit}

BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS DETECTED:
- Long-time Cart Abandonment (5+ min): ${behaviorSignals.longTimeCartAbandonment}
- Cart Item Removed: ${behaviorSignals.cartItemRemoved}
${behaviorSignals.cartRemovalCount ? `- CART REMOVAL COUNT: ${behaviorSignals.cartRemovalCount} (Escalation Level)` : ''}
- Long-time Inactive (24+ hours): ${behaviorSignals.longTimeInactive}
- Engagement Score: ${behaviorSignals.engagementScore}/100
- Risk Level: ${behaviorSignals.riskLevel}

DETECTED REASONS:
${behaviorSignals.reasons.length > 0 ? behaviorSignals.reasons.map(r => `- ${r}`).join('\n') : 'No specific triggers detected'}

üö® CART REMOVAL ESCALATION POLICY:
- 1st Removal: User is exploring options - DO NOT CALL. Monitor behavior. (Alternative: Send gentle reminder email)
- 2nd Removal: User showing hesitation - BE ON ALERT. Consider calling only if cart value > $75 or high-value items.
- 3rd+ Removal: CRITICAL - User about to abandon! Strong recommendation to call if cart has any value.

${behaviorSignals.cartRemovalCount === 1 ? '‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS: First removal - Give user space to explore. DO NOT call unless cart value > $100.' : ''}
${behaviorSignals.cartRemovalCount === 2 ? '‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS: Second removal - User is hesitating. Consider calling if high value or premium items in cart.' : ''}
${behaviorSignals.cartRemovalCount >= 3 ? 'üö® STATUS: Third removal - CRITICAL! User likely to abandon. Strong call recommendation.' : ''}

DECISION CRITERIA:
Consider these factors when deciding whether to call:

CALL WORTHY SCENARIOS (High Value):
- Cart value > $50 with items sitting for 5+ minutes
- User removed high-value items from cart (shows serious consideration)
- Previously active user hasn't visited in 24+ hours
- Multiple engagement drops indicating genuine interest but hesitation

NOT CALL WORTHY SCENARIOS (Low Value/Intrusive):
- Very low cart value (< $20) - not worth the interruption
- User just started browsing (< 2 minutes on site)
- Cart abandonment on very cheap items
- User seems to be just window shopping
- Recent new user who might not be familiar with the brand yet

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Is this the right time of day to call?
- Would an email or SMS be less intrusive but equally effective?
- Has enough time passed to indicate genuine abandonment vs. just thinking?

Please analyze this situation and respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "shouldCall": true/false,
  "confidence": 85,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why you recommend calling or not calling",
  "alternativeAction": "If not calling, what should we do instead? (email, SMS, wait, etc.)",
  "urgency": "low/medium/high",
  "expectedOutcome": "What do you expect to happen if we call?",
  "callScript": "Brief suggested approach for the call if shouldCall is true"
}

Be thoughtful about the user experience. A well-timed, helpful call can save a sale, but a poorly timed or unnecessary call can damage the relationship.`;

- Times they've modified cart: ${removalCount}
- Last browsing category: ${lastCategory}
- Urgency level: ${claudeAnalysis.urgency}
- Expected outcome: ${claudeAnalysis.expectedOutcome}

CONVERSATION STRATEGY:
${claudeAnalysis.urgency === 'high' ?
  '- This is a critical recovery call - user is close to purchasing but hesitant\n- Focus on removing barriers (price, shipping, product questions)\n- Offer concrete solutions: discount code, free shipping, product comparison\n- Goal: Convert today if possible' :
  '- This is a gentle re-engagement call\n- Focus on understanding their experience\n- Offer value: recommendations, notifications about new products, insider tips\n- Goal: Build relationship and bring them back organically'
}

IF THEY MENTION:
- Price concerns ‚Üí "I totally get it. Let me see what I can do - I can apply a special discount code right now."
- Shipping time ‚Üí "Great question! Most of our ${lastCategory} ships within 2-3 days. Need it faster? We have express options."
- Product questions ‚Üí "Oh yeah, let me pull that up... [pause] Okay so that particular item..." [Be helpful, reference specific details]
- Not interested ‚Üí "No worries at all! Would you like me to send you an email when we have sales on ${lastCategory}?"
- Browsing only ‚Üí "Totally understand! Are you looking for anything specific? I can keep an eye out for you."

NATURAL CONVERSATION TIPS:
- Use filler words: "So...", "Actually...", "You know...", "Um..."
- Acknowledge what they say: "Oh totally!", "Yeah, I get that", "That makes sense"
- Don't rush - let them talk
- Reference the "office" if asked: "Yeah, it's a bit busy in here today!"
- End naturally: "Awesome!", "Perfect!", "Sounds good!"`;
